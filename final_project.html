  <H5><u>Introduction</u></H5>
  <p> The objective of this project was to create a wireless XBee network, Controlled by an Arduino, that would read data from various sensors and post that data on a webserver. this data could then be
  used to control different systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  originally I wanted to create a irrigation system where soil moisture would be analyzed and water dispersed
  accordingly, although currently it only reads light levels in terms of Lux, I could replace the LDR with a moisture sensor.
   A LDR voltage reading is taken every 5 seconds and output as a Lux reading.
   <br/>
   <br/>
    The Arduino will update my webserver every time that the XBee sends data and will update Thingspeak every 20 seconds.  Click

  To go To my Thingspeak Channel Graph.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, I have created a control element on my webserver.  A button will turn an LED light on and off, controlled by the Arduino.
I can also set it up such that the LED will flash every time The XBee sends data, which is every 5 seconds.</p>
