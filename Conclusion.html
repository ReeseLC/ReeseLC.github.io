  Creating the XBee network seemed to be the easiest part of the project and the Arduino code was
  definitely the most difficult, mostly because it has to be near perfect to work, at least in respect
  to syntax errors which can come up quite often, throwing the code completely off base.  There were a few
  things that I attempted to make my project do that in the end I had to give up on, like a second sensor or a
  ThingTweet connection, but i still enjoyed a lot of aspects of the project and I still plan to refine it and
  use it as a base for my Final Project next semester.
