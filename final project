  <The objective of this project was to create a wireless XBee network that would read data from various sensors and post that data on a webserver. this data could then be 
  used to control different systems.  originally I wanted to create a irrigation system where soil moisture would be analyzed and water dispersed 
  accordingly, although currently it only reads light levels in terms of Lux, I could replace the LDR with a moisture sensor.</p>

 To go To my Thingspeak Graph. A LDR voltage reading is taken every 20 seconds and output as a Lux reading, which is then transmitted to both my thingspeak channel and my 
 webserver</p>
